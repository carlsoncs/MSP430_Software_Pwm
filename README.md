This is software for the MSP430-g2553 that uses pulse 
width modulation to dim LED's.  The pulse width 
modulation is generated in software using  Watch
Dog Timer interrupts.  

I just wrote this today, so at this point it isn't
very good. I am hoping to improve it so that I can
use it to drive three much larger LED circuits.  
(In that setup the pwm signals will command the base
of a BJT which in turn commands the Gate of a FET. )

I will need to improve this implementation before I 
get to that point.  

If you have any suggestions for me, please leave me
a message!
